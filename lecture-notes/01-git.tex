\section{Bash}
Bash is a Unix shell used in Linux and Mac OS that lets you interact with
the operating system through typed commands. We will mainly use it to run
git commands, but there are many other useful commands worth noting.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \texttt{pwd} - Print Working Directory \\
        Prints the directory you're currently on.
    \item \texttt{ls} - List \\
        List the items contained in a given directory.
    \item \texttt{cd} - Change Directory \\
        Move to another working directory.
    \item \texttt{mkdir} - Make Directory \\
        Create a new directory with the specified name.
    \item \texttt{touch} - Create File \\
        Create an empty file or update the timestamp of an existing file.
    \item \texttt{mv} - Move/Rename \\
        Move a file or directory to a new location or rename it.
    \item \texttt{cp} - Copy \\
        Copy files or directories to a specified location.
    \item \texttt{rm} - Remove \\
        Delete files or directories (use \texttt{-r} for recursive deletion).
    \item \texttt{echo} - Print Text \\
        Print text or the value of a variable to the terminal.
    \item \texttt{cat} - Concatenate and Display \\
        Display the content of a file or combine multiple files.
\end{enumerate}

We can use these commands as follows (note that code starting with
\texttt{\$} is a common convention to indicate Bash commands):

\begin{verbatim}
# Start off by printing our current working directory
$ pwd
/Users/MyUser

# List the files and directories contained in /MyUser
$ ls
Applications    Downloads    Music       bin
Desktop         Library      Pictures    miniconda3
Documents       Public

# We can pass flags to most commands to access additional options
$ ls -l  # List items with detailed information

# Let's move into /Documents using a relative path
$ cd ./Documents  # "." represents the current directory

# We could have achieved the same thing using an absolute path
$ cd /Users/MyUser/Documents/

# We can create a new directory
$ mkdir my-project

# We can create a new file inside the new folder
$ touch my-project/file.txt

# Let's move file.txt back to Documents and rename it
$ mv my-project/file.txt renamed-file.txt

# Let's copy renamed-file.txt back into my-project and rename it
$ cp renamed-file.txt my-project/copied-file.txt
\end{verbatim}

\pagebreak
\begin{verbatim}
# Let's delete renamed-file.txt
$ rm renamed-file.txt

# We can pass some text to a file with pipes
$ echo "Hello world\!" > my-project/copied-file.txt

# Let's display the file's contents to check if it worked
$ cat my-project/copied-file.txt
Hello world!

# We can append new text to the file >>
$ echo "A new line of text" >> my-project/copied-file.txt

# Let's see how the file changed
$ cat my-project/copied-file.txt
Hello world!
A new line of text

# We can replace the file's contents using a single pipe
$ echo "Starting over\!" > my-project/copied-file.txt

# Instead of appending a new line, we overwrote the whole file
$ cat my-project/copied-file.txt
Starting over!
\end{verbatim}
