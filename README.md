# Econometrics II (2025)
Welcome! This is the repo where you'll find all the material seen in class.
It is also the place you'll be pushing all your assignments to.

This repo is meant to resemble a typical industry-grade project. This means
you'll have to follow a few styling and coding guidelines for your work to be
accepted.

## Why this workflow?
In this class, you're expected to submit your code by opening a PR, passing
a few builds and merging your branch into `main`. The goal of this workflow
is to help you understand how code is shared in modern companies. It will
get you used to:
- Writing clean, consistent, and well-documented code;
- Opening pull requests (PRs) to submit your work for review; and
- Passing automated checks for code style and linting.

By following these guidelines, you won't be taken by surprise when someone
asks you to open a PR to squash a bug or implement a new feature.
